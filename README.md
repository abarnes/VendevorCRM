# Vendevor CRM
The Vendevor sales team needed a CRM to manage prospects and leads and we did not feel like paying over $1000 for a Salesforce.com subscription.  This was built to meet the specific needs of the sales team without any frills, and was built in two days on CakePHP using the default frontend styling.
